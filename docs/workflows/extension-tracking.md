# Extension Tracking & Execution

Identify returns requiring extensions, file extensions before deadlines, and track extended returns through completion.

## Extension Deadlines

### Individual Returns (1040)
- Original Due: April 15

## Extension Identification

### Automated (Tax Helper)
System automatically flags returns for extension when:
- 7 days before deadline
- Status is: Intake, Documents Pending, Documents Complete, In Preparation
- Extension not already filed

### Manual Check (Weekly)
During tax season, review:
1. Pull all active returns from CCH
2. Sort by due date
3. Identify returns unlikely to complete in time
4. Create extension list

### Extension Criteria
File extension if:
- Missing critical documents
- Complex issues requiring research
- Client unreachable for questions
- Preparer workload prevents completion
- Client requests extension

## Filing Process

### Form 4868 (Individual)
1. Open Drake
2. Create extension return
3. Enter client information
4. Estimate tax liability (important!)
5. Generate Form 4868
6. E-file extension
7. Provide client copy

### Form 7004 (Business)
1. Open Drake
2. Create business extension
3. Select appropriate form type
4. Calculate estimated tax
5. Generate Form 7004
6. E-file extension
7. Provide client copy

## Extension Tracking

### CCH Updates
1. Change return status to "Extension Filed"
2. Update due date to extended deadline
3. Add note with extension confirmation number
4. Set reminder for extended deadline

### Client Communication
Send extension notification:
- Confirm extension was filed
- New due date
- Estimated tax payment info (if applicable)
- What's needed to complete return

### Tracking Dashboard
Maintain extension tracking list:
| Client | Return Type | Original Due | Extension Filed | New Due | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|---------|--------|

## Payment with Extension
**Important:** Extension is to FILE, not to PAY

If client owes taxes:
1. Estimate tax liability
2. Advise client to pay estimated amount
3. Payment avoids/reduces penalties
4. Payment can be made via:
   - IRS Direct Pay
   - EFTPS
   - Check with extension

## Post-Extension

### Monitoring
- Set calendar reminder for extended due date
- Follow up on missing documents monthly
- Update client on progress
- Re-prioritize once documents complete

### Status Updates
Track extended returns separately:
- "Extension - Waiting on Docs"
- "Extension - In Preparation"
- "Extension - Ready"

### Second Extension
Individual returns generally do NOT get second extension.
Some business returns may qualify - consult tax manager.

## Common Issues

### Extension Rejected
- Verify SSN/EIN
- Check for duplicate filing
- Correct and refile immediately

### Client Didn't Pay Estimates
- Calculate potential penalties
- Discuss with client
- Document conversation

### Missing Extended Deadline
- File return ASAP
- Calculate penalties/interest
- Discuss with tax manager
- Communicate with client

## Notes
- Extensions are FREE to file
- Never miss an extension deadline
- Always estimate taxes conservatively
- Keep confirmation numbers
- Extended returns should be completed before October 1
