# Client Drop-Off Workflow

## Purpose
Efficiently process client document drop-offs while ensuring all necessary information is captured and documents are properly handled.

## Context
**~50% of clients drop off physical documents in person.** This creates a scanning bottleneck where staff must manually scan each page before documents can be processed through OCR. Future enhancements will streamline this physical-to-digital workflow.

## Steps

### 1. Greet Client
- Welcome client warmly
- Confirm name and verify identity if new client
- Ask purpose of visit (drop-off, pick-up, questions)

### 2. Collect Documents
- Receive all documents from client
- Do NOT sort or review documents in front of client
- Accept documents in whatever order provided

### 3. Document Inventory
- Create a brief mental note of document types
- Check for common items:
  - W-2s
  - 1099s (any type)
  - K-1s
  - Property tax statements
  - Mortgage interest statements
  - Prior year return (if new client)

### 4. Create Routing Sheet
Fill out routing sheet with:
- [ ] Client name
- [ ] Contact phone number
- [ ] Date and time of drop-off
- [ ] Drop-off method: In-Person / Left at Door
- [ ] List of documents received (general categories)
- [ ] Any special instructions from client
- [ ] Estimated completion date
- [ ] Payment status/arrangement

### 5. Log in CCH
- [ ] Look up client in CCH Practice Management
- [ ] Create new engagement if needed
- [ ] Update status to "Documents Received"
- [ ] Add any notes from conversation

### 6. Document Processing
**Using Tax Helper OCR (replaces GruntWorx):**
1. Scan documents using office scanner
2. Upload to Tax Helper dashboard
3. System automatically extracts data (W-2s, 1099s, etc.)
4. Review extracted data for accuracy
5. Enter data into Drake
6. Place physical documents in preparer's bin
7. Label folder with client name and date

### 7. Client Communication
- Provide estimated completion timeframe
- Confirm preferred contact method
- Offer receipt copy if requested
- Thank client for their business

## Missing Documents
If documents appear incomplete:
- Note missing items on routing sheet
- Do NOT delay accepting drop-off
- Flag for preparer follow-up
- System will auto-notify client of missing items

## Payment
- Ask if client would like to pay at drop-off
- If yes, follow Payment Processing workflow
- If no, note payment arrangement on routing sheet

## Notes
- Never keep client waiting to sort documents
- Physical documents go to preparer bin same day
- Update CCH status immediately after drop-off
